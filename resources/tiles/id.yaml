# Do we need an ID system for blocks?
# ...actually on second thought yes. I was thinking about implementing an
# overcomplicated per-map-basis dictionary for the index of blocks for compression
#
# Probably best to write a simple saving algorithm and then use external tools to
# compress properly. We can work on our own map compression optimised for PGG later.
