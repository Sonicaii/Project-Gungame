# Do we need an ID system for blocks?
# ...actually on second thought yes. I was thinking about implementing an
# overcomplicated per-map-basis dictionary for the index of blocks for compression
#
# Probably best to write a simple saving algorithm and then use external tools to
# compress properly. We can work on our own map compression optimised for PGG later.

# Tiles may have custom directories such as dirt. Structure as follows:
# - ["directory name", "tilemap name", "other texture names", "range", ["alternates"]]
# Where "other texture names" and "range" are optional
# "range" is starting_num..ending_num
# 
# Trying to keep the system the most simple but most scaleable simultaniously.

Misc:
  dir: "."
  list:
    - air

# In order of the original tile selection menu.
